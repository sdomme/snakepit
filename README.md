# snakepit

## Description

Package Python software as an RPM including all dependencies (even the
interpreter).

This solves the problem of an outdated Python (2.6) on RHEL since we can now
deploy self-contained RPMs that are independent.

The source of truth for the software to be installed is the Python package
index at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi

## Example

See the file `snakepit.yaml` for details on how to build a spec file for
`moto`.

You can then:

```
$ snakepit snakepit.yaml
```

Which will produce a `moto.spec` file.

For more information on options:

```
$ snakepit -h
```

## Building the resulting `*.spec` files.

The resulting spec file requires the `make-opt-writable` rpm which you can
build using the `make-opt-writable.spec` (included in repository) file. This is
required due to very low-level reasons related to the way in which miniconda
is installed.

Furthermore, the spec file is of a special flavour of `svn2rpm` which can be
found at: https://github.com/immobilienscout24/svn2rpm/. You may not yet be
able to use the spec files w/o this tool and the surrounding boilerplate.


## How does it work?

For a given product to build an RPM for---let's call it
`mypackage`---`snakepit` will create a spec file. The spec file works as
follows:

* Install anaconda/miniconda to `/opt/mypackage`
* Install the product into that installtion using `pip`
* Setup any symlinks from `/opt/mypackage/bin` to `/usr/bin`
* Copy the whole installation into the buildroot

## Using private PyPi index

If you want to use your private PyPi please set the following variables in your yaml:
```
pypi_package_name:    package
symlinks:             ['package']
pypi_package_version: 1.0
pypi_package_summary: My package
pypi_package_licence: private
pypi_index:           https://private_pypi_url
```
In general private index are not able to provide metadata information such as version, summary, licence

## Installation

It is available from PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/snakepit

To install, do:

```
$ pip install snakepit
```

## Use PyRun as Python distribution to build a spec-file

You do not need any make-opt-writable rpm or svn2rpm. Simply build your spec-
file in userspace and reduce the rpm size more than by half.


### Example based on [gaius](https://github.com/ImmobilienScout24/gaius) and Pyrun
```
~ $ git clone https://github.com/ImmobilienScout24/gaius.git
~ $ virtualenv .venv
~ $ . .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) ~ $ pip install pip -U
(.venv) ~ $ pip install snakepit
(.venv) ~ $ snakepit gaius/snakepit/gaius.yaml --distribution=pyrun
(.venv) ~ $ deactivate
~ $ rpmbuild -bb gaius.spec
~ $ ls  rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64
gaius-128.0-0_pyrun_2.1.1_py2.7.x86_64.rpm
```
Some other SL6 Server:
```
~ $ sudo rpm -i gaius-128.0-0_pyrun_2.1.1_py2.7.x86_64.rpm
~ $ gaius
    Usage:
        gaius --stack STACK --parameters PARAMETERS --trigger-channel TOPIC_ARN
             [--region REGION] --back-channel QUEUE_URL [--timeout TIMEOUT]
```

## Development

Use pybuilder: http://pybuilder.github.io/

## Getting in touch

Please use the conda mailinglist at: https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!forum/conda

## Status

This tool is in an early alpha stage and the output is guaranteed to change.
Feedback, comments and pull-requests welcome, but please do bear in mind that,
this is work in progress and therefore probably full of many, many horrible
bugs.

## TODO

### YAML Spec


* Install optional dependencies, e.g. `ipython[all]`
* What if we want to install conda packages?
* What if we have a complex dependency chain?
* What if we want to install multiple products?
* Ability to package additional things, such as bash completions, cron-jobs and
  so on.
* Ability to install from a git-repo
* Ability to run all tests before creating the RPM (usually not possible if
  from PyPi)
* Add a 'minimum_snakepit_version' number and abort if snakepit is too old.

### RPM Spec

* Include git-hash of snakepit in spec
* Include version number of conda-dist
* Download .sh installer via Source0
* What about the illegibility of the spec file template
* Decouple from make-opt-writable
* Decouple svn2rpm
* `--pre` and `--post` hooks for the spec file
* Release number should also contain the python version
* Augment the description with complete metadata
* Automagically determine the symlinks. (either by doing deltas during install,
  or by inspecting the metadata.)
* Change package name from `product`-`conda-dist` to something the user can
  select.
* In case we want to install c-extensions, we may need to add c-compiler and
  other things to the ``build-requires``.

### Interface

* Specify template file via `--template`
* Allow outputing the spec file on stdout using `--stdout`
* Decide if it should be '--build' or '--release'
* If no file specified, it should look for a `snakepit.yaml` or `.snakepit.yaml`

### Miscellaneoous

* Consider "snakepyt" as name
* Figure out how to get the cram-plugin to write coverge data too
* Maybe we can delete things from the miniconda install that are not required
  since it is now static. E.g. stuff in `pkg`. This would help to reduce the
  size of the final RPM.
* Consider https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller as an alternative
* Delete pip and conda after installing everything to remove the temptation to
  install things as root on the box. In fact, perhaps make a 'debug' yaml flag
  that allows to craete such packages.
